Honeychrome v0.6.1 Release Notes

This release contains several new features and improvements, usability improvements and many bug fixes.

Features and improvements
* Cytometry plots now make better use of colourmap range: firstly, there is less blue, more of the higher colours. Secondly, the inside and edges of the 2D histograms are scaled independently.
* There is now a hotspot matrix viewer added to the Spectral Process tab, following Mage et al.
* A "density cutoff" setting has been added to App Configuration, which is the lowest number of events per bin to show a colour in the 2D histograms. Set to 0 to ignore the cutoff.
* There is a new statistical comparison: samples can be compared by histogram overlays.

Usability
* Now user must click to select cell of spillover matrix / nxn plots before rolling scroll wheel. Stops the accidental changing of spillover by using the scroll wheel.
* There is a new status message on window reload to invite user to load sample.
* Improved scrolling - cytometry plots now ignore mouse wheel.
* Improved import flow: user can either place FCS files in experiment folder or link to existing folder.
* Click to open file dialogs in experiment settings.
* Tooltips on heatmap horizontal headers to avoid problem with clipped names.
* Scrolling on spectral model editor no longer messes up selection.
