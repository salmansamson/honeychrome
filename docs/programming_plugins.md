# Programming and Plugins
Honeychrome can be extended with Python plugins that define a new tab in the Honeychrome main window. The guide below specifies how to set one up and gives examples.

Plugins have full access to the data in the application: 
- the experiment's metadata (raw and unmixed cytometry, spectral process, list of samples and controls, settings)
- the ephemeral data (gating hierarchy, transforms, lookup tables, current plots, etc)
- the current sample
- the set of signals to communicate with other parts of the GUI

> **Note:** If you want to use the plugin functionality, please install the full Honeychrome Python package to have control over the libraries.

## Specification of a Plugin
A plugin must be named *_tab.py and placed in the Experiments/plugins folder (within the user's home folder) to be found by Honeychrome. The minimal plugin must provide a name ('plugin_name'), which will be used as the tab's name, and a class PluginWidget (subclass of PySide6.QtWidgets.QWidget), which will be displayed within the tab.

The initialisation method of PluginWidget must accept the following arguments:
- controller: this object contains all data in the application
- bus: the signals bus which can be used to communicate with the rest of the GUI

The minimal code for a plugin is the following:

```
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QWidget

plugin_name = 'Blank Example Plugin'

class PluginWidget(QWidget):
    """
    The main UI container for the plugin.

    Required arguments:
        bus: the signals to communicate with the rest of the honeychrome app
        controller: the honeychrome controller including all ephemeral data and the experiment model
    """
    def __init__(self, bus=None, controller=None, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.bus = bus
        self.controller = controller
```

## Accessing Data
The following data can be accessed through the controller:

1. Experiment object (data saved in the .kit file) contains all data necessary to re-generate the state of the controller (along with the sample data in the FCS files)
```
controller.experiment.settings   # settings
controller.experiment.samples   # list of samples
controller.experiment.process   # data associated with the spectral process, including the spectral model, profiles, spillover matrix and AutoSpectral AF profiles
controller.experiment.cytometry   # data associated with raw and unmixed cytometry
controller.experiment.statistics   # statistical comparison data
```

See [experiment_model.py](https://github.com/salmansamson/honeychrome/blob/main/src/honeychrome/experiment_model.py) for a full definition.

2. Ephemeral data (data in memory of the running application)

```
controller.experiment_dir   # absolute path of current experiment folder
controller.current_sample   # current sample (flowkit.Sample object)
controller.current_sample_path   # path of current sample (relative to experiment folder)
controller.live_sample_path   # path of live acquisition sample data (relative to experiment folder)
controller.raw_event_data   # numpy array of raw sample data of current sample in all channels
controller.unmixed_event_data   # numpy array of unmixed sample data of current sample in all channels
controller.transfer_matrix   # matrix that transforms the raw data into the unmixed data (i.e. the unmixing matrix, plus extra rows/columns for the non-fluorescence channels
controller.raw_transformations   # transformations of the data in all raw channels (wrapper to flowkit.transform objects)
controller.unmixed_transformations   # transformations of the data in all raw channels (wrapper to flowkit.transform objects)
controller.raw_gating   # gating hierarchy for raw data (flowkit.GatingStrategy object)
controller.unmixed_gating   # gating hierarchy for unmixed data (flowkit.GatingStrategy object)
controller.raw_lookup_tables   # lookup tables for fast gating in all gates defined on raw data
controller.unmixed_lookup_tables   # lookup tables for fast gating in all gates defined on unmnixed data
controller.current_mode   # name of tab currently live in the main window
controller.data_for_cytometry_plots_raw   # a copy of the cytometry_data_dictionary for raw data
controller.data_for_cytometry_plots_unmixed   # a copy of the cytometry_data_dictionary for unmixed data
```

The cytometry data dictionary bundles ephemeral data that is required for cytometry plots or statistical comparisons, and is defined as follows:
```
cytometry_data_dictionary = {
    'pnn': None, # list of channel names
    'fluoro_indices': None, # list of fluorescence channel indices to the list of channel names
    'lookup_tables': None, # dictionary of boolean lookup tables for each gate on the 1D or 2D plot on which the gate is defined (for fast gating)
    'event_data': None, # event data (which may be raw or unmixed depending on the copy of the dictionary)
    'transformations': None, # set of transforms for all channels
    'statistics': {}, # event statistics for each gate in the hierarchy
    'gating': GatingStrategy(), # flowkit.GatingStrategy object used to define the gating lookup tables
    'plots': [], # set of cytometry plot definitions (1D histograms, 2D histograms, ribbon plots referencing the channel names, source gates and child gates
    'histograms': [], # set of 1D and 2D histograms for plotting on the plots
    'gate_membership': {} # dictionary of gate membership for each gate, boolean array corresponding to event_data
}
```

The controller also contains the communications to the instrument driver and trace analyser processes, and the live queue of oscilloscope traces.

The full definition of the [controller](https://github.com/salmansamson/honeychrome/blob/main/src/honeychrome/controller.py) is according to the source code.

The [transform](https://github.com/salmansamson/honeychrome/blob/main/src/honeychrome/controller_components/transform.py) class is a wrapper around the flotkit.Transform, as defined in the source code.

## Reusable functions and classes
Honeychrome contains many reusable functions and classes that may be useful in a plugin. See the following in particular, which are all demonstrated in the [data_processing_example_tab.py](/plugin_templates/data_processing_example_plugin_tab.py)


### ExportablePlotWidget
ExportablePlotWidget puts a matplotlib figure into a widget, with a button for export. Arguments are:
- figure (required): a matplotlib figure object
- title (optional): a string for the figure title, also used as the filename on export
- experiment_dir (optional): absolute path of folder to save the image

Example Python code:
```
from honeychrome.view_components.exportable_plot_widget import ExportablePlotWidget
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

figure, ax = plt.subplots(1)
ax.scatter(np.arange(100), np.arange(100)**2)

plot_widget = ExportablePlotWidget(figure, title="Example Plot", experiment_dir=self.controller.experiment_dir)
```
Example display of this widget:
![exportable_plot2.png](/assets/exportable_plot2.png)


### OrderedMultiSamplePicker
OrderedMultiSamplePicker is a sample picker widget, which produces an ordered list of samples as an output. Arguments are:
- title (optional): string
- source_samples (optional): list of source samples

The list of source samples can be updated after initialisation with the method OrderedMultiSamplePicker.set_items(source_samples)

Example Python code:
1. set up widget
```
from honeychrome.view_components.ordered_multi_sample_picker import OrderedMultiSamplePicker
self.picker = OrderedMultiSamplePicker(title="Choose Source Samples for Processing")
```

2. add samples to it
```
from pathlib import Path
all_samples = self.controller.experiment.samples['all_samples']
source_samples_relative_to_raw = [str(Path(sample).relative_to(self.controller.experiment.settings['raw']['raw_samples_subdirectory']))
                                  for sample in all_samples]
self.picker.set_items(source_samples_relative_to_raw)
```

3. retrieve selection
```
selection = self.picker.get_ordered_list()
```

Example display of this widget:
![sample_picker.png](/assets/sample_picker.png)

### CopyableTableWidget
CopyableTableWidget displays a table which can be copy/pasted e.g. into a spreadsheet. Arguments:
- list_of_dicts: list where each element is a dict containing the data for a row of the table
- headers: ordered list of columns (strings)

Example Python code:
```
from honeychrome.view_components.copyable_table_widget import CopyableTableWidget
headers = ['Index', 'Colour', 'Count']
list_of_dicts = [
 {'Index': -1, 'Colour': '#7f7f7f', 'Count': 0},
 {'Index': 0, 'Colour': '#8c3bff', 'Count': 3691},
 {'Index': 1, 'Colour': '#018700', 'Count': 36414}
]
table_widget = CopyableTableWidget(table_data, table_headers)
```

Example display of this widget:
![table_widget.png](/assets/table_widget.png)

### with_busy_cursor
Use as a decorator on any heavy function or class method so that a mouse spinner is displayed while running.

Example Python code:
```
from honeychrome.view_components.busy_cursor import with_busy_cursor

@with_busy_cursor
def example_function():
    ...
```

## Example Plugins
Two plugins are provided in the Honeychrome package as examples:
- Hello World Example Plugin [hello_world_example_plugin_tab.py](https://github.com/salmansamson/honeychrome/blob/main/plugin_templates/hello_world_example_plugin_tab.py)
  - demonstrates the minimal plugin
- Data Processing Example Plugin [data_processing_example_plugin_tab.py](https://github.com/salmansamson/honeychrome/blob/main/plugin_templates/data_processing_example_plugin_tab.py)
  - demonstrates a plugin that accesses unmixed data over a set of samples, displays sample picker, demonstrates a toy UMAP workflow, produces graphs, tables, output text

These are automatically copied to the Experiments/plugins folder when Honeychrome is started. To enable the plugins, go to menu Edit > App Configuration.
